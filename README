When invisible man mode is turned on all players will be switched to ct and a random player will be picked to go t.
The player on t will be invisible and only be able to use a knife.
The t's job is to kill all the ct's to stay t and the ct's job is to survive.
Whoever kills the invisible t becomes the next t.
If the t types kill in console or falls to his death a new random ct is picked to become the next t.
Team locking is also on when this mod is on so players can only join the ct team or go spectator.
